  			<h3>MYOFASCIAL RELEASE and MOBILIZATION:</h3>
  			<p>This work, pioneered by John F Barnes, is my specialty.

It differs from other types of massage because it addresses restrictions

and habitual patterns deep within the connective (fascial) system

,which directly affect every other system, including emotional, in the

body. This work is done without oils, going just to the barrier, and then

allowing the body to “unwind” or release long held restrictions . I love it

because it is non-invasive, great for Acute injury when the body won't

tolerate traditional work, and only goes with the body’s invitation, so it

is powerful but never painful. I often

combine with more traditional techniques in a session depending on

session goals. Most people will feel better immediately, and I will work

with you after treatment to address any soreness or emotions that can

arise, as your fascial system often will continue to release several days

post treatment.</p>

			  <h3>Deep Tissue, Injury Treatment</h3>
			  <p>Specific, structural reorganizing, rebalancing based on client information/complaints and my observations of their particular patterns to injuries. This is a very deep myofascial and muscular work taken just to tolorance working in tandem with the client
        to release core or new injuries/restrictions, allowing freedom of movement as well as reduced pain and stiffness</p>

  			<h3>Cranial Sacral</h3>
  			<p>Working with the deepest layers of fascia, this treatment follows a 10-step protocol to assess and realse myofascial restrictions on the brain cavity and dural tube.
        Essential for migranes and recurring headaches, it also help immunity and other regulatory systems in the body.
      Can be combined with Deep Tissue for a truly effective approach to chronic pain.</p>

        <h3>Hot Stone</h3>
        <p>Ancient cultures have used this practice to produce deep, healing relaxation and warming detoxification of the tissues< I use the stones as an extentions of my own hands, with either a treatment intention, deep clearing and relaxation, or both. Stones can be placed on or above blocked areas, and/or the body's energy centers to encourage release. Extremely grounding in nature, this ancient healing art is a truly unique full body experience./p>

      <h3>Hawaiian Lomi Lomi/Thai Table</h3>
      <p>"Lomi Lomi" means salmon in Hawaiian, with a deeper meaning of "returning to the source." This deeply moving, prayerful bodywork is profoundly healing, relaxing and energixing at the same time. Yin/Yang energatic interplay, stretches, and full length strokes with movement/rocking are hallmarks of this work. I blend with Thai moves/compression for the ultimate experience.</p>

      <h3>Margaret Carter LMP</h3>
      <p>In private massage Practice since 1996, I bring several decades of

massage experience and training to your time with me.

I have in the past spent 26 years as a group exercise trainer, which lends

a unique understanding of movement and rehabilitative strengthening

options to your session. I spent my first few years in practice tutoring at

risk students at Seattle Massage School after graduating with a 4.0 GPA.

I continue to expand my skills and training, most recently taking Thai

Massage classes and to advance my Myofascial Education with John F

Barnes PT.
</p>
<p>
I have worked in Chiropractors offices and hair salons, as well as my

own private locations. Each one has rounded out experience in different

areas , like relaxation/spa massage verses injury treatment after work

or car accidents. I can literally see restrictions in the body, and often

without prior knowledge, can tell exactly what has happened in a car

accident by the way the body responds after impact. This is helpful to

tell me where I should concentrate our sessions .
</p>
<p>

I have been a Stanwood area resident since 1984, raised all 3 grown

sons in this community as a single mom, and my massage practice has

been serving clients here since 1996. I currently still reside in the same

home with my partner Ron and our awesome cat , O’Malley.

In my spare time I love to grow food, cook, snowboard, hike our

incredible Northwest mountians, and travel as much as I can.</p>

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>

    <p class="para">
      I believe each person is a complex system of body/mind relationships

      which make up the whole. We are not just body, and muscle/bone, but

      mind, and digestive, skin, other systems. Our emotions, as well as habits,

      play a part in how we feel, as well as our stress levels, and methods for

      managing that. The nutrition and hydration we choose also plays a large

      part. Though my specialty is massage, I do take these influences into

      account when working together for total body health and wellness for

      you.

      <div class="col-sm-12 melva">
        <blockquote>
          <p>“As a client of Margaret Carter for the past 16 years, I can testify to the ongoing health benefits that massage has afforded me.
A few years back I needed to see an orthopedic physician due to an injury from childhood, his assessment was that because
of all the alternative health practitioners I receive treatments from my range of motion and level of disc deterioration was not
as severe as it would have been considering the level of injury to my neck and back. He concluded that because I availed
myself of such therapies surgery was not an optional treatment and to continue with the massage and other therapies."</p>
